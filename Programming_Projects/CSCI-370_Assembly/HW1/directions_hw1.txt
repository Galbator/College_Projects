Modify the following assembly language program such that your
name is included in the comment section and such that it prints
the contents of the source file on the screen.

; --------------------------------------------------
; Displays the contents of a file on the screen.
;
; Compile with: nasm -f elf64 hw1-yourname.asm
; Link with: ld hw1-yourname.o -o hw1-yourname
; run with: ./hw1-yourname
; --------------------------------------------------
section .data
  file db "hw1-yourname.asm",0 	;filename ends with '\0' byte
section .bss
  descriptor resb 4 		;memory for storing descriptor
  buffer resb 1024
  len equ 1024
section .start
global _start
_start:
  mov eax,5 			;open
  mov ebx,file 			;filename
  mov ecx,0 			;read only
  int 80h 			;open filename for read only

  mov [descriptor],eax 		;storing the descriptor

  mov eax,3 			;read from file
  mov ebx,[descriptor] 		;your file descriptor
  mov ecx,buffer 		;read to buffer
  mov edx,len 			;read len bytes
  int 80h 			;read len bytes to buffer from file

  mov edx,eax 			;storing count of readed bytes to edx
  mov eax,4 			;write to file
  mov ebx,1 			;terminal
  mov ecx,buffer 		;from buffer
  int 80h 			;write to terminal all readed bytes from buffer

  mov eax,6 			;close file
  mov ebx,[descriptor] 		;your file descriptor
  int 80h 			;close your file

  mov eax,1
  mov ebx,0
  int 80h
