HW-9		CS370	10 points	Due: Monday, 4/4/2022

Use my MIPS simulator to write a program that calculates ODD parity 
on the bit string entered. Your code must prompt for 8 bits (0 / 1):

Please enter a bit:
Please enter a bit:
Please enter a bit:

.
Please enter a bit:

Your code must then count up the number of 1's and set the ninth bit
such that the final number of 1's is ODD.

Your code must then redisplay the 8 bits on a single line with the
parity bit on the next line:

10101010
1

Notes:
You must also hold for a key press before terminating the program. 

You cannot change the MIPSsim code in anyway.

You can compile MIPSsim.c using gcc MIPSsim.c

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on the Linux Mint machines in Engineering.
3. Your source code must be named hw9-yourname.mips
4. Your source MUST excute using the MIPSsim program (./MIPSsim hw9-yourname.mips). 
5. Failure to follow the above directions will result in loss of points.
