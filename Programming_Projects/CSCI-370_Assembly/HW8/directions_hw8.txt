HW-8		CS370	10 points	Due: Monday, 3/28/2022

Use my MIPS simulator to write a program that counts from A to B. You must 
prompt the user for a starting number by displaying:

Please enter a number: 

Your code must then count, by 1, from the number (N) entered to N+10 and display 
that result, 1 number per line:

2
3
4
...


Notes:
You must use a loop for the incrementing.

You must also hold for a key press before terminating the program. 

You cannot change the MIPSsim code in anyway.

You can compile MIPSsim.c using gcc MIPSsim.c

If the number becomes greater than 9, you can just print out the applicable
ascii character(s), which would be :;<=> etc (see an ascii character table).

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on the Linux Mint machines in Engineering.
3. Your source code must be named hw8-yourname.mips
4. Your source MUST excute using the MIPSsim program (./MIPSsim hw8-yourname.mips). 
5. Failure to follow the above directions will result in loss of points.
