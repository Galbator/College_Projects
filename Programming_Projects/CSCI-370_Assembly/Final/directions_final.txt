Final Exam		CS370	100 points	Due: Monday, 5/9/2022

Use my MIPS simulator to write a RegFile program that plays a character 
guessing game.

Your code must do the following:
0) Record a target character (ascii value). This can be statically programmed.

1) Display: "Guessing Game"
            "-------------"

2) Display: "Enter a character:"

3) Aquire the character from the keyboard and compare it with the target character 
   you recorded in step 0.

4) If the characters do NOT match, then:
   1) If the ascii value of the entered character is smaller than that saved 
      in step 0 you must display "Too Small"
   2) If the ascii value of the entered character is larger than that saved 
      in step 0 you must display "Too Large"
   3) You must then jump back to step 2.

5) If the characters DO match you must display: "You Won!" and exit the simulator.

EXTRA CREDIT VERSION (+50 points)
---------------------------------
0) Record at least 4 target characters (ascii value). These can be statically 
   programmed. The last character should be Q or X.

1) Display: "Guessing Game"
            "-------------"

2) Display: "Enter a character:"

3) Aquire the character from the keyboard and compare it with the current target 
   character you recorded in step 0.

4) If the characters do NOT match, then:
   1) If the ascii value of the entered character is smaller than that saved 
      in step 0 you must display "Too Small"
   2) If the ascii value of the entered character is larger than that saved 
      in step 0 you must display "Too Large"
   3) You must then jump back to step 2.

5) If the characters DO match you must display: "You Won!" and then display
   "Play Again [Y or N]?:".

6) Aquire a character from the keyboard and compare it with the character 
   Y.

7) If the player did NOT enter Y. Exit the simulator.

8) If the player DID enter Y, then increment to the next target character.

9) If the next target character is Q or X (whatever you picked), exit the simulator,
   otherwise jump back to step 2.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. You cannot change the MIPSsim code in anyway.
2. You can compile MIPSsim.c using gcc MIPSsim.c
3. You MUST use a "for" loop to display the "-------------" text to the screen. 
4. You MUST use a branching statement for testing the saved and entered character.
5. Your program must run on the Linux Mint machines in Engineering.
6. Your source code must be named final-yourname.mips
7. Your source MUST excute using the MIPSsim program (./MIPSsim final-yourname.mips). 
8. The extra credit is all or nothing.
9. Failure to follow the above directions will result in loss of points.
