HW-7		CS370	20 points	Due: Monday, 3/21/2022

Use my MIPS simulator to write a program that displays your name (first
and last) on the screen. Your name must use uppercase for the first letters
of your first and and last name. You must have a space between the names.
For example:

Ronald Marsh

Notes:
You must load the ascii values into RAM and then display the contents of the
RAM. This is how you will display your name.

You must also hold for a key press before terminating the program. 

You cannot change the MIPSsim code in anyway.

You can compile MIPSsim.c using gcc MIPSsim.c

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on the Linux Mint machines in Engineering.
3. Your source code must be named hw7-yourname.mips
4. Your source MUST excute using the MIPSsim program (./MIPSsim hw7-yourname.mips). 
5. Failure to follow the above directions will result in loss of points.
