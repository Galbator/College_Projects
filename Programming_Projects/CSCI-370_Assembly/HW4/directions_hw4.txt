Write a C program that prompts the user for a HEX value (assume

into decimal and displays the result, and that converts the 
decimal value into binary and displays the result.

Example:
--------
Enter your HEX value: 1A2B3C

The decimal value is: 1715004

The binary value is: 110100010101100111100

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on the Linux Mint machines in Engineering.
2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your program.
3. Your source code must be named hw4-yourname.c
4. No external libraries or templates may be used (ie the 
   HEX-decimal and decimal-binary conversion must be of your
   own design).
5. Failure to follow the above directions will result in loss of points.
