Program# 3

Write a program to create and test the Account class. The Account class models a bank account of a
    customer, and it is designed as follows:
        • The class has three instance variables:
            o Id, a String identifying uniquely the account
            o Name, a String representing the name of the account owner
            o Balance, an int representing the available amount in the account
        • The class has three methods:
            o The method credit(amount), which adds amount to balance and returns balance.
            o The method debit(amount), which subtracts the given amount from balance if amount <=
                balance, otherwise, it prints "amount exceeds the available balance”. The method returns balance.
            o The method transferTo(anotherAccount, amount) transfers the given amount from this
                Account to the given anotherAccount if amount <= balance, otherwise, it prints “amount
                exceeds balance”. The method returns balance.
            
1. Write two constructors for the class Account. The first one takes in two arguments, and the
    second one has three arguments, Account(id, name), and Account(id, name, balance).

2. Write the three getters for each instance variable, getID(), getName(), and getBalance().

3. Implement the three methods credit(amount), debit(amount), and transferTo(anotherAccount,
    amount).

4. Test your class in the main program by creating two objects for the class account and testing all
    the above methods.
