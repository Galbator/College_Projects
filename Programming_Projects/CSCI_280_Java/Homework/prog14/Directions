        • Read an input string from the keyboard using BufferedReader and print it to the console.
        
        • Read the previous read string object from the file input.txt -
            using StringReader, and print it character by character, each character in a line.
            
        • Print the previous read string object to a file called “output.txt” using PrintWriter.
