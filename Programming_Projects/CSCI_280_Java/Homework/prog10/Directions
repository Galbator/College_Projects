Program# 4

1. Create a class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annual InterestRate to store the annual
    interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable
    savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit.

2. Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly Interest by multiplying the
    savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12, this interest should be added to
    savingsBalance.

3. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value.

4. Write a program to test the class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects, saver1
    and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%,
    then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for both savers. Then set the
    annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for both
    savers.
