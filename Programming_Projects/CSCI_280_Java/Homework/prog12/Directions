Program #12
Write a java program to get an input of two integers from the user and print the sum - 
    of the two numbers.
    
Add an exception block to handle the mismatch input when the user enters a non-integer input.

If the user enters an input that does not match the integer type, - 
    ask the user to re-enter an integer input.

Stop when the user enters two integer inputs and count the invalid integer - 
    inputs entered. Print the sun and the invalid integer attempts.
