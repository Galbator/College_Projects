'Python' Setup Guide -

Startup:
	Import OS: 'import os' {Not Required: Check avaliable Libraries}

	IMPORTANT: Python does NOT require semi-colons ';' at end of line!
	 - Above applies for all data types (functions, var, classes, etc...)
	 - Use tabs or spaces but not both else Errors happen
	 - Python is all about indentation {NO currly braces allowed}
		EX: 'for char in string:
		     |  if (char == 'x')
		     |  |  q +=1
		     print("q is: ", q)'

Comments:
         - Supports both single line and Mulit-line commenting
           - Single-line EX: [ # This is a Comment ] --- Pound/ Hash key
           - Multi-line EX: [ ''' This is a Comment ''' ] --- Triple Single Quotes

Variables:
	Defined var is the same as Declared var
	 - EX: 'variable1 = 5'

	Python will automatically decide which type variables are:
	 - int, float, strings, etc...
	 - Also automatically do garbage collection and freeing memory

Functions:
	Just need the definition
		EX: 'def countWords(string):
		     |  #Random code - single line comment
		     |  #Python does NOT support multi-line comment blocks'

	Main function must be written like any other function and called accordingly
		EX: 'def main():
		     |  #code
		     |

		     main()' Call for main function

Classes:
	 - Can define functions to be used in class {Review classes documentation}

	Syntax:
		'class nameOfClass:
		 |   def __init__(self):
		 |   |   #Variables
		 |   |   self.firstName = 'None'
		 |   |   self.lastName = 'None' 
		 |   |   self.middleInitial = 'None' '
