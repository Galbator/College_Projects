Free Pascal 2.6.4
Implements Standard Pascal - supports Delphi and Turbo Pascal 7.0

To compile a Pascal program
fpc sourceFile.pas
** creates the output file sourceFile **

fpc sourceFile.pas -oexecutableFile
** no blank space between -o and the name of the executable file **
** creates the output file executableFile **

Ignore the "/usr/bin/ld: warning: link.res contains output sections; did you forget -T?" message, the output file will still be created.
Go to "http://www.freepascal.org/faq.var#unix-ld219" for more information about the message.
