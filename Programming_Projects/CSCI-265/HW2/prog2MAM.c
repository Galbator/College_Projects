        Write each of the following programs in C, C++, Python, and Java.
        Write a program that surveys the majors of students in some unnamed class.
        Only majors Iâ€™m concerned with are Computer Science, Data Science, and Cyber Security.
        For only the CS majors we want to ask about their minor.
